# Eniac Brazil Expansion Analysis

This repository contains the SQL scripts and analysis performed on **Magist’s dataset** as part of Eniac’s market expansion evaluation into Brazil.  
The main objective was to assess whether Magist is a suitable partner for Eniac by focusing on two critical concerns:

1. **Product Fit** – Can Magist handle high-end tech products?  
2. **Delivery Performance** – Are Magist’s delivery times fast enough for Eniac’s standards?
